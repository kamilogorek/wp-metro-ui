Metro UI template for Wordpress
===============================

I couldn't find any nice template, so I've made my own. I'm lazy from definition, so there is still a lot things to do. I'll do them when I'll find some time.

You are using this template on your own responsibility :P

* Remember to use some menu, because otherwise you'll see creepy page list
* Social icons are hardcoded, so you need to change them or leave them as they are to promote my site ;)
* A lot of other things won't work, but like I said - I'll fix them when I find some free time.

That's all for now. I hope you'll forgive me someday ;)
