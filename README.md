Metro UI template for Wordpress
===============================

Created because I couldn't find nicer template and I made my own. From definition I'm lazy so there is still a lot things to do here. I do them when I find some time.

You are using this template on your own responsibility :P

* Remember to use some menu, because otherways you'l see creepy page list
* Social icons are hardcoded so you need to change them or leave them to promomote my site ;)
* A lot of other things wont work, but like I said - I fix then when I find some free time.

That's all for now. I hope you forgive me some day ;)
